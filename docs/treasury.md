# Treasury DAO

Treasury is a DAO that holds XTZ and FA2 tokens and lets its users decide how to
spend its XTZ and tokens. Its extra storage data is a unit value and thus contains
no data.

Its `proposal_metadata` contains proposal types:
- Transfer proposal that includes:
   - a list of transfer instructions. Each item in this list can be either of an Xtz transfer, an FA2 token transfer or an FA1.2 token transfer. These alternatives are represented by the type,
      ` (or (pair %xtz_transfer_type (mutez %amount) (address %recipient))
                                   (or (pair %token_transfer_type
                                          (address %contract_address)
                                          (list %transfer_list
                                             (pair (address %from_) (list %txs (pair (address %to_) (nat %token_id) (nat %amount))))))
                                       (pair %legacy_token_transfer_type
                                          (address %contract_address)
                                          (pair %transfer (address %from) (pair %target (address %to) (nat %value))))))`
   - `nat %agoraPostID` is used to refer to an Agora post explaining the proposed transfer and motivation for it.
- Proposal to update the guardian address in the BaseDAO contract.
   - This proposal takes an address parameter and use it to update the guardian address in the storage.
- Proposal to update the contract delegate.
   - This proposal takes a `keyhash` `option` parameter and usees it to update the delegate address of the contract. Please note that this different from the `Update_delegate` entrypoint which updates the delegates of an account.


## Configuration callbacks

### Proposal check

The proposer must lock `frozen_scale_value * s + frozen_extra_value` tokens where `s = size(proposal_metadata)`.
I. e. `s` is total size of the transfers and post ID.
It should naturally prohibit spam proposals and too big proposals (unless `frozen_scale_value` is 0).

Additionally, we require `s < max_proposal_size` as a safety measure because too large proposals can be too costly to deal with in terms of gas.
`max_proposal_size`, `frozen_scale_value` and `frozen_extra_value` are parameters of the contract specified by the DAO creator.

Note that by setting `frozen_scale_value` to 0 it's possible to require a constant number of tokens to be locked.

For XTZ transfers their amount must be in range `[min_xtz_amount .. max_xtz_amount]`.
`max_proposal_size`, `frozen_scale_value`, `frozen_extra_value`, `min_xtz_amount` and `max_xtz_amount` are parameters of the contract specified by the DAO creator.
Additionally, for XTZ transfers `CONTRACT unit` instruction must pass for the `recipient` address, i. e. this address must be an implicit account or refer to an entrypoint of the `unit` type.

### Rejected proposal slash amount

When a proposal is rejected, the amount of tokens to slash is computed as
`slash_scale_value * frozen / slash_division_value`, just like in Registry DAO.

### Decision callback

For the Transfer proposal, it makes all requested transfers one by one.
 - In case of insufficient balance the decision callback can fail.
    + For XTZ transfers it sends `amount` to the `recepient` address with `unit` parameter. I. e. it returns a single `TRANSFER_TOKENS` operation.
    + For FA2 transfers it calls `transfer` entrypoint of the `fa2` contract with given argument.
    + For FA1.2 transfers it calls `transfer` entrypoint of the `fa1.2` contract with given argument.

For the Update guardian proposal, it updates the guardian address in the storage.

## Custom entrypoints

Treasury DAO does not contain any custom entrypoints and its custom entrypoint type is unit.
